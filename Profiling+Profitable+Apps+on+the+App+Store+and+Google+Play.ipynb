However, with only 6 apps in this Genre, it seems that a few very popular apps are dominating and making the genre appear more popular than it really is. This can be confirmed with the following code. "

In the case of many players in one genre (i.e a fragmented market), competition is very high and maybe characterised by a lot of switching by users, preventing a build up of users required to access higher ad revenues. Conversely, a genre with low competition but dominated fiercely by few players (like the Navigation) might not be profitable due to brand being an entry barrier. \n",

    "- Across the iOS and Android apps, the Reference and Books & Reference (respectively) genres were found to be the most profitable for app developers as they struck the balance between scale (number of ratings/installations) and degree of competition (not too competitive to make standing out hard and not too uncompetitive to be dominated by few brands/apps).\n",
    "- A Quran app that consolidates the features(availability in different languages, availability in various lines per page etc) seen on the various Playstore apps to limit fragmentation  but also add new features such as audio/discussion forums to encourage user switching.\n",
